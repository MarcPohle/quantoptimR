Description: The package implements tests for optimality of quantile forecasts over possibly multiple horizons
    and multiple quantiles based on Mincer-Zarnowitz quantile regressions. The basic test checks the null hypothesis 
    of autocalibration, there are two extensions, one test for stronger forms of optimality and one for a multivariate setting.
